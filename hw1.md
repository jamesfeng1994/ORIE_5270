# What we covered and why does that matter?

### 1. AWS

Covered: how to install and launch an AWS EC2 Linux instance and how to connect the server through SSH. 

AWS provides the flexibility to work remotely so that we could run programs which need large computing resources over night
such as a deep learning parameter tuning program. 

### 2. Linux

Covered: the basic commands.

Linux is a secure, stable and flexible operating system, which is usually the default environment of most cloud servers. 
As a result, in order to better use some cloud servers such as AWS we should know some basic operations of Linux such as 
modifying permissions as well as installing packages through yum or apt-get.
   
### 3. VIM 

Covered: how to switch the mode and the basic operations like writing and saving.

VIM is an effiicient text editor which is almost covered by most operating systems. Usually it's the only one text editor
we could use in the cloud server at first.

### 4.Git

Covered: how to create a new repository; add, commit and push a new file to the existing repository; 
how to create and delete a new branch; how to merge new branches to the master branch.

Git is maybe the most popular version control systems now, people could use it to easily inspect codes and 
work together on the same project offline.

### 5. Shell

Covered: brief introduction to shell language and interpreting an easy example.

Shell allows users to write and implement your own scripts and tools. 
   
### 6. Python Classes

Covered: the basic concept of classes

The reason we need classes in object-oriented programs is because the class is the fundamental unit of abstraction 
in object-oriented programming.
